# iPhoto2Web

The intent of this program is to create a directory structure of images,
thumbnails, and html pages by reading the iPhoto® Library's sqlite3 database.
Rather than copying the images and thumbnails from the iPhoto Library,
iPhoto2Web creates symlinks to the actual files referenced in the iPhoto Libray
database.

**NOTE:** Currently, this program is only useful with iPhoto ‘09 (version 8.1.2 (424)) as
the structure and items within the library package often change between
versions.
