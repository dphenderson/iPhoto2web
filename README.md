# iPhoto2Web

The intent of this program is to create a directory structure of images,
thumbnails, and html pages by reading the iPhotoÂ® Library's sqlite3 database.
Rather than copying the images and thumbnails from the iPhoto Library,
iPhoto2Web creates symlinks to the actual files referenced in the iPhoto Libray
database.
